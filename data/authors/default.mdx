## Suraj Rimal

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science from Coventry University, class of 2024. I was working at Zorsha Technologies, where I have gained over a year of specialized experience in backend development, DevOps, and machine learning.

Beyond my professional role, I am an entrepreneur at heart, having founded and co-founded multiple ventures throughout my bachelor's degree. I established PremiumSalad, a business dedicated to healthy outdoor eating for Nepalese consumers, though it ultimately ceased operations. I also co-founded Bariya, a one-day settlement parcel delivery company that used advanced algorithms to optimize delivery routes for maximum efficiency, which later faced closure. My ventures extended to Cloudbot Technologies, a company focused on designing, importing, and developing advanced robotics and parts, which also could not sustain long-term operations.

As the CEO and founder of Zorsha Technologies, I led an IT outsourcing firm specializing in system design and development services. Although the company was closed in 2024, it was a significant milestone in honing my leadership and technical skills. Additionally, I co-founded Nepalâ€™s second-largest stock analyzer application for NEPSE, scaling the platform to serve millions of clients and delivering data-driven insights to investors across the country.

My career goal is to transition beyond coding and excel in quantitative finance and AI-driven trading. I am passionate about leveraging AI agents and advanced quantitative techniques to address the complexities of emerging economies' stock markets. By applying cutting-edge AI technologies, I aim to drive innovation in finance and contribute to building intelligent solutions that enhance market efficiency.

I am also planning to pursue further studies in the USA, seeking a university or professor whose research aligns with my vision of advancing AI applications in finance. My ambition is to join a role or academic program that supports my commitment to integrating AI-driven solutions into the financial sector while contributing to groundbreaking advancements in the field.
