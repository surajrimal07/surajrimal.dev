## Suraj Rimal

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science from Coventry University, class of 2024. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a profound interest in the intersection of technology, finance, and artificial intelligence. My experiences encompass entrepreneurship, hands-on involvement in financial markets, and technical expertise in backend development, DevOps, and machine learning. These have equipped me with the skills and determination to solve complex problems in emerging and underdeveloped economies.

In 2016, during my second year of college, I ventured into entrepreneurship by launching **PremiumSalad**, Nepal’s first hygienic and authentic salad-focused cloud kitchen. Although innovative and technologically enabled, the business faced challenges with market traction and ceased operations in 2017. This experience taught me the intricacies of business scaling and the importance of consumer engagement. Following this, I founded **Cloudbot Technologies**, an automation and robotics firm dedicated to creating affordable robotic solutions and parts. Collaborating closely with the Nepal Innovation Center, the company advanced robotics education in Nepal. However, due to misaligned corporate visions, I sold the company in 2019.

In 2020, I co-founded **Variya**, an innovative, tech-enabled same-day delivery and payment settlement service. While praised in local and national media for its efficiency and vision, the venture encountered operational hurdles, with same-day payment settlements proving unsustainable. It eventually closed in 2021. These entrepreneurial efforts honed my resilience, adaptability, and leadership, qualities that are now integral to my approach toward problem-solving and innovation.

In addition to my entrepreneurial endeavors, I gained significant hands-on experience in **investing and trading** through my collaboration with a Nepal Stock Exchange broker firm. This exposure gave me a deep understanding of **trading strategies, portfolio management, technical and fundamental analysis, market cycles, and the influence of macroeconomic factors** such as interest rates, government policies, and fiscal decisions. These experiences have sharpened my expertise in financial markets and fostered my passion for empowering others to understand the importance of finance and investment. I believe these skills and insights are my strengths, forming the foundation of my goal to contribute to the financial sector meaningfully.

In 2022, I joined **Raratech** as Technology Head, focusing on backend development and DevOps while strengthening my technical expertise further. Later, I returned to complete my bachelor’s degree, graduating in May 2024. My most recent venture, **Zorsha Technologies**, was an IT outsourcing firm that also explored diverse technological innovations, including launching its own social media-based e-commerce platform. Though Zorsha closed in 2024, it was instrumental in deepening my technical and managerial capabilities.

My career goal is to address the complex challenges faced by financial markets in underdeveloped and emerging economies. I am deeply passionate about leveraging advanced AI technologies to create intelligent systems that enhance accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in finance. I aim to help the youth in these regions understand the significance of financial literacy, proper investment strategies, and active stock market participation. By integrating **AI with finance**, I aspire to contribute to building sustainable financial ecosystems that can uplift individuals and economies alike.

I thrive on tackling challenging problems, remaining focused and dedicated to finding innovative solutions. My hands-on experience in finance, trading, economics, and entrepreneurship equips me with a unique perspective on these fields. I am actively pursuing opportunities—whether through professional work or university research—to advance AI-driven systems that address financial disparities and promote equitable growth.

Currently, I am preparing to pursue advanced studies in the USA, seeking a university or professor whose research aligns with my vision of revolutionizing finance through AI. By combining my technical expertise, entrepreneurial background, and financial insights, I am committed to driving groundbreaking advancements that make a real-world impact and improve economic opportunities on a global scale.
